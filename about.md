My name is Joseph Delmastro. I was born and raised predominantly in Eau Claire Wisconsin, a small college town in Northwest Wisconsin. I moved to the coast of North Carolina in 2016, received a B.A. in Economics at UNC Chapel Hill in 2022, and have been back and forth between the two states ever since.

I am an experienced political organizer and researcher with an interest in public policy.
