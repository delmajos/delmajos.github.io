<h3 id="suicide">Suicide</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In 2022, Wisconsin’s suicide rate for men was 24.2 compared to only 6.4 for women (WI DHS)$^1$, higher than the United States’ overall suicide rate of 23.0 for men, and 5.9 for women (CDC) $^2$. Men are almost <em>4 times</em> more likely to commit suicide in Wisconsin than women.</li>
  <li>Rural Wisconsinites are 30% more likely to commit suicide than urban Wisconsinites, leaving rural male Wisconsinites particularly vulnerable. $^1$</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drug-overdose">Drug Overdose</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The male share of 2022 drug overdose deaths is 68.3%, with urban areas having almost double the drug death rate than rural areas $^3$ $^,$ $^4$.</li>
  <li>From 2016 to 2023, there were 6,198 men and 2,877 women who died of an opioid overdose in Wisconsin $^4$.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Education </h1>

<h3 id="primary--secondary-education">Primary &amp; Secondary Education</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Men make up only 1/4 of all teachers in WI. $^5$</li>
  <li>Average Forward Scores (WI assessment) have male students barely exceeding female students in meeting the benchmarks in Mathematics and Science, but almost 10% behind in meeting the benchmark in English.$^6$</li>
  <li>Male WI high school graduates scored about 4% worse on the ACT in 2022 than females, with higher scores in Mathematics, but lower scores in English, Writing, and Reading $^7$.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="post-secondary">Post-Secondary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Despite meager differences in average ACT scores, male high school graduates are 25% less likely than females to attend post-secondary education 1 year after graduating. $^8$</li>
  <li>According to a recent survey of college students enrolled at public universities, men are much more likely than women to adopt pro-free speech positions on a range of issues, and report feeling more uncomfortable about expressing their positions on controversial issues, especially if conservative. $^9$</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Incarceration </h1>

<ul>
  <li>Men made up 93.1% of the prison population in October 2024 $^1$ $^0$, and made up almost 80% of the total Community Supervised population, a total of 50,000 men in Wisconsin $^1$ $^1$. In 2021, more people were sent back to prison from breaking a rule of extended supervision, than from a new sentence $^1$ $^2$.</li>
  <li>Conditions in many of these WI Correctional Facilities are extremely poor, with an investigation by the NYTimes showing chronic understaffing leading to abuse of prisoners’ rights including access to medical care, family visits, and fresh air $^1$ $^3$.</li>
